# dynsity

Python tools to infer **dynamical densities** of protoplanetary disks based on their rotational profiles, following the approach in [Teague et al. (2018)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018ApJ...868..113T/abstract).

The hope is that not only will one be able to extracted radial volume density profiles, but also place some constraint on the total dynamical mass of the disk and, to a lesser extent, the surface density profile.
